# ATM
OOP ATM Simulation using Java With Simple GUI


The ATM System is the project which allows users to  create and access their bank accounts in order to make cash withdrawals, cash transfer , cash deposit, getting the transactions history of the account. Whenever the users need to make any process they can enter their user ID and their PIN number 

It covers all the oop concepts such as Encapsulation, inherithance , polymorphism, Abstraction.
the program is covered with exception handling to prevent the program from crashing under any condition.
the md5 cryptographic hashing function is used to store the pin of each user in a secure way.
the date class is used to provide the user with a fully detailed transactions.

Data is Stored in the form of objects providing full implementation of Encapsulation concept.


To develop this ATM system the entire operation has been divided into the following 
step: 
1. verification process
2. account selection 
3. Banking services

The program is designed in such a way that the user has to card number and pin number. Once 
verified, he is provided a menu and he/she had to enter the option provided in the 
menu. For example, when the user wants to view the list of payment/transactions history than 
he/she had to enter the option for payment history provided in the main menu. When 
the option is entered alone with the respective argument, then the payment history is 
displayed on the screen.
that we used GUI (Graphical User Interface) in this project so that it will become more users friendly to interact.

Each transaction got a memo (a random number entered by the user , this number will be listed with the transaction as transaction id )
